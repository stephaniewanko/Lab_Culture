**********WORD OF CAUTION*************
I am a first year PhD student. I have worked under four different PIs, 
but I have never been on the other side (ie the PI). Take these with a grain of salt. 
**************************************

These are things that I think make a lab run well. 
I am writing them down as I think about choosing a lab for my PhD and also for potentially running a lab in the future. 

1)Have an annual state of the lab address. 
  -accomplishments of the last year, individuals and entire lab.
  -generate some lab goals for the next year. 
  -review the grants the lab holds and the main aim of these grants. Do the grants match up with what the overall goals of the lab is? 
 
 2)Have an annual lab town hall.
  -review lab logistics
  -make amendments to lab logistics as needed
  
 3)Regular check-ins with each lab member.
   -Every 3-4 months, make sure this check in is about the long term view of 
   -make sure lab members know it is OK to come in with no results. You can discuss a paper, talk about the lab, experimental difficulties, life, ect
   
 4)Make annonyomous survey about how the PI and/or other people in the lab are doing.
   -You can't change what you don't know.
   
 5)Have group meetings with overlapping and/or adjacent projects.
  
 6)Have lab social time in lab (ie weekly, biweekly lunch, coffee hour, ect). 
    -don't set an adgenda
  
 7)The biggest thing a PI can do to control lab culture is to hire the right people. 
   
 8)Don't put multiple people on the same project. And if two projects are adgacent, make sure you help them stear clear of running into eachother.
